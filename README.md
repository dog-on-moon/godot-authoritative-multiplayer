# Godaemon Multiplayer

**Godaemon** (or the *Good Daemon*) is a server-authoritative multiplayer API for Godot 4.4. Inspired by [Astron](https://github.com/Astron/Astron), Godaemon provides an immediate framework for developing any kind of multiplayer game, especially for larger projects.

This is my third attempt at developing a multiplayer framework in Godot. This plugin is created based on what I felt was lacking from Godot in regards to efficient multiplayer development, and I hope it will serve your purposes too.

## Documentation

The Godot project also comes with a couple of demos.

## Installation

This repository contains the plugin and some simple demos. Copy the contents of the `addons` folder into the `addons` folder in your own Godot project. Be sure to enable the plugin from Project Settings.

As of writing, this plugin depends on functionality introduced in Godot 4.4 dev3 (more specifically [this PR](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/96024)).
